## My Infotainment System and Android Auto



  
When I got my new car initially it comes with a very good infotainment system with is has only few modern ways to integrate and listed to

The car is equipped with a 12.2” inches wide screen with a resolution of 1920X720

The infotainment system is equipped with Bluetooth and a Chinese phone screen mirroring called QDlink and that app was the only way you can get Google Maps navigation on car’s screen.

And unfortunately, this must be wired connected to the corresponding USB port and phone screen always has to be on during the mirroring session which I don’t like, another problem is that screen mirroring
Is not utilizing the entire screen only about 2/3 of the screen is used during the mirroring.

Luckily after about one month from when I purchased the car the dealership starts providing an infotainment system update which brought Wired Apple Carplay to the system.

Majority of the owners was happy, but I wasn’t as I am an Android user.

After small research for alternatives, I have found that some Russian Telegram groups start providing a service to modify the Infotainment system and add many things to it including Android Auto and APK installation.

I then contacted them to fine that the price the ask for the service was about USD 500, This can’t be done remotely, and car dash and screen need to be removed to be able to remove the infotainment computer and then they can connect to it and modify and of course this will void the warranty, so this solution is no go for me.

From what I have read that since the car shipped without Android Auto support then it will never receive it later as an update since Google must Approved and certified the system in pre-launch phase.

So now I am in a mission to hunt for an aftermarket dongles and boxes, a very known name for such was Carlinkit company, they have a three solution mainly but many items under this.

* To Air
  * Simply to changes wired connection to wireless but for a dedicated use case (CarPlay **or** Android Auto)
* Mixed To Air
    * Like the first but support both CarPlay or Android Auto
* Android Box
  * A full flagged dedicated android box (SCO and RAM and Storage with full Android OS) which has some preinstalled Apps and Wireless CarPlay and Android Auto.
 
All of the solutions need a Car with Wired Apple CarPlay which I have.

> I have went to the second option (Mixed To Air) to simmply convert Wired Apple Carplay to Android Auto and the Matching device from Carlinkit was Carlinkit 4.0

After ordering Carlinkit 4.0 immediately I noticed that something is wrong with the aspect ratio and whatever I done changing settings or fiddling with the firmware configuration it was always not rendering correctly and screen either stretched or compressed.

Second issue that It was sometimes freeze and show black digital garbage on screen and I must reset the entire setting to make it work again which was frustrating and after contacting Carlink official support they suggest that mostly my car is not supporting it well or the item is faulty and asked to return it.

I have then processed a return request on AliExpress and deliver it back and got refunded.

> Now the next step is to test Carlinkit Android AI box (I don’t know why they call everything nowadays AI)



### I ordered it from "TBox Plus" AliExpress and I have scored a very good deal ordering it at USD 72.5 , there was three variant items from Carlinkit

Specs wise there is marginal difference with change SOC adds about 10-15% performance which is not that effective.
But important difference is depending on your use case that the first model has only SD card allow you to physically add data and files
Second model has USB port, and third model has USB Port and HDMI output port which they charge almost double the price for older models.

When I got the device, it was a great works as expected boots up and start with and connects within les that a minute (In my case was 30-40 seconds ) and I set it to automatically
Connect wirelessly to My Android Phone

It has many great functions , you have Google Play store so installing any App is possible , despite the original infotainment systems here you can install video and streaming Apps (it is extremely dangerous to drive and watch videos in same time)
YouTube , Apple TV , IPTV all is possible but of course you will need to either insert a Data SIM card or connect it to your Mobile Phone Hotspot Internet.

I am not going to write a review for the device since YouTube is full of it and in many languages.
